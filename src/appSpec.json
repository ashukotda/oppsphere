        "designSummary": "**The Opportunity Canvas: Minimalist Clarity with Strategic Accents**\n\nThe OppSphere brand identity is built upon the principle of 'Minimalist Clarity,' drawing inspiration from the disciplined elegance of Japanese Zen gardens and the functional purity of Dieter Rams' design philosophy. Our approach is to create a transparent, highly functional digital space that serves as a perfect canvas for the diverse opportunities we present. The design will be characterized by an extreme, disciplined use of negative space, a strict adherence to a multi-column grid for perfect alignment, and a refined typographic hierarchy. While the core aesthetic is clean and monochromatic, strategic use of a sophisticated blue and soft purple palette will introduce a modern, trustworthy, and premium feel, guiding the user's eye to critical actions and information without overwhelming the minimalist foundation. Animations will be subtle and functional, enhancing the user experience rather than distracting from it. This synthesis ensures OppSphere feels both cutting-edge and profoundly accessible.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **The Grid as Foundation:** A strict 12-column grid will govern all layouts, ensuring perfect alignment and balance. Content will be structured within this grid, with generous padding to maximize negative space.\n2. **Typography as the Primary Voice:** A single, highly legible Sans-Serif font will be used. Hierarchy will be achieved through precise variations in size, weight, and case, ensuring readability and a premium feel.\n3. **Color Restraint:** A base of white and light grey will dominate. A primary blue and a secondary soft purple will be used sparingly for CTAs, links, and key interactive elements, reinforcing trust and modernity.\n4. **Whitespace as a Design Element:** Generous use of negative space will define sections and create visual breathing room, making content easily digestible and highlighting the 'premium' aspect.\n5. **Functional Animation:** Animations will be subtle, focusing on smooth transitions for state changes (e.g., hover effects, modal openings) and gentle reveals, enhancing usability without compromising the minimalist aesthetic.\n6. **Iconography for Clarity:** Simple, line-based icons will be used for categories and key features, providing immediate visual cues without adding decorative clutter.",

The `'secondary'` color (electric lime) is a decorative accent; use it for graphical flourishes like borders, sticker backgrounds, or icon backdrops. Do NOT use the `'secondary'` color for text on the `'background'`, as it lacks contrast. Instead, use `'secondaryForeground'` for any text placed on top of `'secondary'` elements. The `'subtleDivider'` is used for horizontal rules that separate content sections without adding visual weight.",

The `'brandAccent'` (rust orange) on `'background'` meets WCAG AA standards for normal text and AAA for large text, making it safe for headlines and links. The `'secondary'` color (lime green) does NOT meet contrast standards against `'background'` and must be restricted to non-text graphical elements or backgrounds.

Our approach is to create a transparent, highly functional digital space that serves as a perfect canvas for the diverse opportunities we present. The design will be characterized by an extreme, disciplined use of negative space, a strict adherence to a multi-column grid for perfect alignment, and a refined typographic hierarchy. While the core aesthetic is clean and monochromatic, strategic use of a sophisticated blue and soft purple palette will introduce a modern, trustworthy, and premium feel, guiding the user's eye to critical actions and information without overwhelming the minimalist foundation. Animations will be subtle and functional, enhancing the user experience rather than distracting from it. This synthesis ensures OppSphere feels both cutting-edge and profoundly accessible.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **The Grid as Foundation:** A strict 12-column grid will govern all layouts, ensuring perfect alignment and balance. Content will be structured within this grid, with generous padding to maximize negative space.\n2. **Typography as the Primary Voice:** A single, highly legible Sans-Serif font will be used. Hierarchy will be achieved through precise variations in size, weight, and case, ensuring readability and a premium feel.\n3. **Color Restraint:** A base of white and light grey will dominate. A primary blue and a secondary soft purple will be used sparingly for CTAs, links, and key interactive elements, reinforcing trust and modernity.\n4. **Whitespace as a Design Element:** Generous use of negative space will define sections and create visual breathing room, making content easily digestible and highlighting the 'premium' aspect.\n5. **Functional Animation:** Animations will be subtle, focusing on smooth transitions for state changes (e.g., hover effects, modal openings) and gentle reveals, enhancing usability without compromising the minimalist aesthetic.\n6. **Iconography for Clarity:** Simple, line-based icons will be used for categories and key features, providing immediate visual cues without adding decorative clutter.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "The primary palette consists of a clean off-white background (#F8F9FA) and dark grey foreground (#333333) for maximum readability. The primary accent color is a vibrant blue (#007AFF), used for primary calls-to-action, links, and interactive elements. A secondary soft purple (#8A2BE2) is used for supporting elements or to create visual distinction in specific sections. Neutral grey (#CCCCCC) can be used for borders, dividers, or secondary text. Ensure high contrast for all text elements against their backgrounds.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "All color combinations must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios. The primary blue and secondary purple are chosen for their accessibility against white and off-white backgrounds. Text on colored backgrounds must also meet contrast requirements. Avoid using purple for critical information if it significantly reduces contrast with the background or primary text."
